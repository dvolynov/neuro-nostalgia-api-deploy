Purpose:
You are tasked with precisely creating CSS code for given HTML strucrure in a retro 90's style. Adjusting HTML or JS is prohibited.

1. **Boxy Layouts**:
   - Use fixed-width containers (e.g., `600px` to `800px`) for a centered, static design.
   - Avoid fluid or responsive layouts.

2. **Bright, High-Contrast Colors**:
   - Incorporate bold colors like red, blue, and yellow or muted vintage tones (e.g., beige, faded green).
   - Use solid, flat backgrounds; avoid gradients.

3. **Simplified Fonts**:
   - Use serif fonts like `Times New Roman`, `Georgia`, or sans-serif classics like `Arial`.
   - Always underline links with classic blue for unvisited and purple for visited.

4. **Visible Borders**:
   - Add 1-2px solid borders around sections, tables, or images using black, gray, or muted tones.

5. **Minimal Shadows**:
   - Apply small, subtle box shadows to containers and avoid blur-heavy effects.

6. **Static Navigation Bars**:
   - Style simple horizontal or vertical menus with flat colors and hover effects.

7. **Basic Buttons**:
   - Use flat buttons with a 1px solid border, minimal hover effects, and no gradients.

8. **Low-Resolution Images**:
   - Use pixelated or monochromatic images and descriptive captions for icons or visuals.

9. **Compact Spacing**:
   - Limit padding and margins to `5px-10px` for a tight, structured design.

10. **No Modern Effects**:
    - Avoid CSS transitions, animations, or dynamic visual effects.
    - Stick to static, straightforward layouts.

11. **Left-Aligned Text**:
    - Use left or center-aligned text for a clean, readable structure.

12. **Decorative Elements**:
    - Add static shapes like stars or simple geometric patterns sparingly.
